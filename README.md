# My Conference Talks and Presentations

## Speaker at SCaLE 22x Conference on March 9, 2025
   [An Introduction to Post-Quantum Cryptography for Linux System Administrators](SCaLE22x_AnIntroToPost-QuantumCryptographyforLinuxSAs.pdf)
   This beginner-friendly session will first introduce the basics of quantum computing and explain why it poses a threat to current public-key algorithms such as RSA, DSA, and ECC. Next, we’ll explore at a high level post-quantum cryptographic algorithms—specifically, lattice-based, hash-based, and code-based encryption schemes—that are being considered as replacements for today’s standards. Participants will learn about open-source libraries and tools that already support post-quantum algorithms, along with their compatibility with widely used Linux services.

## Speaker at SCaLE 19x Conference on July 31, 2022
   [Engaging Students with Customized Linux Images for Cybersecurity Training](https://github.com/mariexcurie/presentations/blob/main/SCALE19x_%20Presentation_20220731_0.pdf)
   Training Middle School and High Schools students in cyber security can be a challenging task especially with engaging students and keeping them on task. Come and learn how customizing Linux installations can help improve participation and engage students in solving cyber defense tasks. We will cover general topics of cyber defense, preparing a themed customized desktop, and using Python programming to automate the customizations. The presenters, a sister and brother high school duo will share their experience with preparing themed Linux VMs for Cybersecurity training based on years of learning Cybersecurity through Cyberpatriots and other CTF competitions.
